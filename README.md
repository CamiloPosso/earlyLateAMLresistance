# earlyLateAMLresistance
Investigations into differences between early and late resistance in AML patients. This repository describes the analysis required for two distinct projects.

## The AML microenvironment catalyzes a step-wise evolution to gilteritinib resistance
This work is currently in press at Cancer Cell. The analysis can be found in [this directory](./cellLineResistanceModel).

## Stromal effects in patient data
There is new extension of this work focusing on the role of stroma in patient data in clinical trial. this analysis can be found in [this directory](./stromaClinicalTrial).
