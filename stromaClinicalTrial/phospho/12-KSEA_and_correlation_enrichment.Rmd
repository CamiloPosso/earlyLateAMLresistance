## Get dataset

We access synapse to load the data in long form. We use data which has been corrected for both
Loading mass effect, as well as plex effect. Below we see a metadata table for this experiment.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
show <- summary %>%
  select(-`BeatAML Patient ID`)
kbl(show) %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = T)
```

Here we perform 4 comparisons. We compare the healthy group to the treated, 
treated & early, and treated & late groups. We also compare the treated & early vs 
treated & late groups.

```{r prepare ratios and limma, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

                              Gene = rep(gene.to.site$Gene, lengths), 
                              Residue = unlist(split.residues)) %>%
  mutate(`single site` = paste(Gene, Residue, sep = "-"))

# Split each phosphosite, ie GENE-S123S125 is split into GENE-S123, GENE-S125
phos.dat.single.site <- merge(phos.dat, single.residues)

phos.mat <- phos.dat.single.site %>%
  select(LogRatio, Sample, `single site`, site) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(values_from='LogRatio',names_from='Sample',
                      values_fn=list(LogRatio=mean),values_fill=0.0) %>%
  mutate(count = rep(1,nrow(.))) 

single.site <- phos.mat$`single site`

# Average duplicate phosphosites (duplicates arise from splitting compound sites, eg GENE-S123S125)
phos.mat <- phos.mat %>%
  select(everything(),-`single site`, -site) %>%
  rowsum(single.site) %>%
  sweep(1, .$count, FUN = "/")
```

In this short report we collect both KSEA for each stated comparison, as well the results of
Jason McDermott's correlation enrichment. 

Correlation enrichment aims to identify pathways whose *genes* are highly correlated.
Within a group of samples, this approach can help identify pathways whose genes shows a high degree of concordance.
For a pathway \(\mathcal{P}\), we compute the correlation between all 
*pairs of genes* belonging to \(\mathcal{P}\), and define the `Correlation Enrichment` 
as the average correlation over all pairs. Values closer to 1 indicate that the genes 
in \(\mathcal{P}\) are tightly correlated; this is the value we plot for each pathway below. 
The p-value measures whether the difference in between the `Correlation Enrichment` and the 
background average correlation among genes is significant.

# Healthy vs Treated

Below we have a KSEA plot computed using the PhosphoSitePlus + NetworKIN
databases. We're comparing the healthy donor samples to all treated samples. 
Red indicates increased activity in treated samples, while blue shows increased activity
in healthy samples. 

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Healthy vs Treated")}
knitr::include_graphics("sig-includedHealthy-vs-Treated-NetworKIN-ksea-plot.png")
```

### Correlation Enrichment

Below we show the correlation enrichment in Healthy samples on the left, 
as well as Treated samples on the right. Kinases with higher enrichment score indicate more 
concordance among the genes in that kinase. We use the PhosphoSitePlus + NetworKIN databases when
computing these results. Note that color does not have any
meaning in correlation enrichment.

# Healthy vs Treated Early period

Below we have a KSEA plot computed using the PhosphoSitePlus + NetworKIN
databases. We're comparing the healthy donor samples to the early period treated samples. 
Red indicates increased activity in early period treated samples, while blue shows increased activity
in healthy samples.

# Healthy vs Treated Late period

Red indicates increased activity in Late period treated samples, while blue shows increased activity
in healthy samples.

# Treated Early vs Treated Late
