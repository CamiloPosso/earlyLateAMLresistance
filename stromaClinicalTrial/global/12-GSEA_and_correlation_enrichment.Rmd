## Get dataset

We access synapse to load the data in long form. We use data which has been corrected for both
Loading mass effect, as well as plex effect. Below we see a metadata table for this experiment.

```{r metadata, echo=FALSE}
show <- summary %>%
  select(-`BeatAML Patient ID`)
kbl(show) %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = T)

```

```{r prepare groups and matrix, include=FALSE}
##select the samples of interest
earliest.samples <- subset(summary, Period == "Early") %>%
  group_by(`BeatAML Patient ID`) %>%
  slice(1)

healthy <- subset(summary, Type == 'Healthy Donor Stroma')%>%
  select(Sample)%>%
  unique()

treated.late <- subset(summary, Period == "Late")%>%
  select(Sample)%>%
  unique()

treated.early <- subset(summary, Period == "Early") %>%
  group_by(`BeatAML Patient ID`) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup(`BeatAML Patient ID`) %>%
  select(Sample) %>%
  unique()

treated.pre <- subset(summary, Period == "Pre-Treatment") %>%
  select(Sample) %>%
  unique()

treated <- subset(summary, Type == 'Treated')%>%
  group_by(`BeatAML Patient ID`) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup(`BeatAML Patient ID`) %>%
  select(Sample)%>%
  unique()

##then we spread the proteomics data into a matrix
colnames(prot.dat)[[1]] <- "Gene"
prot.mat <- prot.dat%>%
  select(LogRatio,Sample,Gene)%>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(values_from='LogRatio',names_from='Sample',
                      values_fn=list(LogRatio=mean),values_fill=0.0)%>%
  tibble::column_to_rownames('Gene')
```

In this report we collect both rank based GSEA for each stated comparison, as well the results of
Jason McDermott's correlation enrichment. 

Correlation enrichment aims to identify pathways whose *genes* are highly correlated.
Within a group of samples, this approach can help identify pathways whose genes show a high degree of concordance.
For a pathway \(\mathcal{P}\), we compute the correlation between all 
*pairs of genes* belonging to \(\mathcal{P}\), and define the `Correlation Enrichment` 
as the average correlation over all pairs. Values closer to 1 indicate that the genes 
in \(\mathcal{P}\) are tightly correlated; this is the value we plot for each pathway below. 
The p-value measures whether the difference in between the `Correlation Enrichment` and the 
background average correlation among genes is significant.

We split the report according to which database we use to perform the analysis.

## Using KEGG

### Healthy vs Treated GSEA

Below we have a GSEA plot computed using the KEGG pathway
database. We're comparing the healthy donor samples to all treated samples. 
Red indicates increased activity in treated samples, while blue shows increased activity
in healthy samples. 

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Healthy vs Treated")}
knitr::include_graphics("sig-includedkegg Healthy vs Treated-gsea-plot.png")
```

### Correlation Enrichment

Below we show the correlation enrichment in Healthy samples on the left, 
as well as Treated samples on the right. Pathways with higher enrichment score indicate more 
concordance among the genes in that pathway. Note that color does not have any
meaning in correlation enrichment.

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%", out.height = "49%", fig.cap="Left: Healthy - Right: Treated",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("sig-included-Kegg Healthy-correlation-enrichment-plot.png",
                          "sig-included-Kegg Treated-correlation-enrichment-plot.png"))
``` 

$$\\[0.2in]$$

### Healthy vs Pre-Treatment GSEA

Below we have a GSEA plot computed using the KEGG pathway
database. We're comparing the healthy donor samples to Pre-Treatment samples. 
Red indicates increased activity in Pre-Treatment samples, while blue shows increased activity
in healthy samples. 

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Healthy vs Pre-Treatment")}
knitr::include_graphics("sig-includedkegg Healthy vs Pre-Treatment-gsea-plot.png")
```

### Correlation Enrichment

Below we show the correlation enrichment in Healthy samples on the left, 
as well as Pre-Treatment samples on the right. Pathways with higher enrichment score indicate more 
concordance among the genes in that pathway. Note that color does not have any
meaning in correlation enrichment.


```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%", out.height = "49%", fig.cap="Left: Healthy - Right: Pre-Treatment",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("sig-included-Kegg Healthy-correlation-enrichment-plot.png",
                          "sig-included-Kegg Pre-Treatment-correlation-enrichment-plot.png"))
``` 

$$\\[0.2in]$$

### Healthy vs Treated Early GSEA

Below we have a GSEA plot computed using the KEGG pathway
database. We're comparing the healthy donor samples to early period treated samples. 
Red indicates increased activity in early treated samples, while blue shows increased activity
in healthy samples. 

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Healthy vs Treated Early period")}
knitr::include_graphics("sig-includedkegg Healthy vs Treated Early-gsea-plot.png")
```

### Correlation Enrichment

Below we show the correlation enrichment in Healthy samples on the left, 
as well as Early period treated samples on the right. Pathways with higher enrichment score indicate more 
concordance among the genes in that pathway. Note that color does not have any
meaning in correlation enrichment.


```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%", out.height = "49%", fig.cap="Left: Healthy - Right: Treated Early",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}

                          "sig-included-Kegg Treated Early-correlation-enrichment-plot.png"))
``` 

$$\\[0.2in]$$

### Pre-Treatment vs Treated Early GSEA

Below we have a GSEA plot computed using the KEGG pathway
database. We're comparing the Pre-Treatment samples to Treated Early samples. 
Red indicates increased activity in Treated early samples, while blue shows increased activity
in Pre-Treatment samples. 

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Pre-Treatment vs Treated Early")}
knitr::include_graphics("sig-includedkegg Pre-Treatment vs Treated Early-gsea-plot.png")
```

### Correlation Enrichment

Below we show the correlation enrichment in Pre-Treatment samples on the left, 
as well as Treated Early samples on the right. Pathways with higher enrichment score indicate more 
concordance among the genes in that pathway. Note that color does not have any
meaning in correlation enrichment.

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%", out.height = "49%", fig.cap="Left: Pre-Treatment - Right: Treated Early",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("sig-included-Kegg Pre-Treatment-correlation-enrichment-plot.png",
                          "sig-included-Kegg Treated Early-correlation-enrichment-plot.png"))
``` 

$$\\[.2in]$$

### Treated Early vs Treated late GSEA

Below we have a GSEA plot computed using the KEGG pathway
database. We're comparing the Treated early samples to treated late samples. 
Red indicates increased activity in treated late samples, while blue shows increased activity
in treated early samples. 

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Treated Early vs Treated Late")}
knitr::include_graphics("sig-includedkegg Treated Early vs Treated Late-gsea-plot.png")
```

### Correlation Enrichment

As we have only two treated late samples, we cannot compute correlation enrichment results
for the treated late samples, as the correlation will always be 1.

database. We're comparing the healthy donor samples to all treated samples.
