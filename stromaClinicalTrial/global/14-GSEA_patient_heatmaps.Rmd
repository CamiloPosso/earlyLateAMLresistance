### Metadata

```{r libraries and setup, include=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(amlresistancenetworks)
library(stats)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(dplyr)
source("../Util/synapseUtil.R")

####### Make sure to run the corresponding script to make the plots. It is in the Making Plots folder.

# corrected for loading mass and plexID, long time and subtle
g.gene.corrected <- querySynapseTable("syn25706561")

prot.dat <- g.gene.corrected

# from here we can select just the metadata of interest
metadata.columns = c('Sample','BeatAML Patient ID','Plex','Loading Mass', 'Description')
summary <- prot.dat%>%
  select(metadata.columns)%>%
  distinct()
summary$Description <- as.character(summary$Description)

# for exploration purposes, we create a new variable containing the type of sample,
# as well as a boolean indicating the time group of the sample.
summary$Type <- case_when(summary$`BeatAML Patient ID` == "Healthy Donor Stroma" ~ "Healthy Donor Stroma",
                          summary$`BeatAML Patient ID` == "Cell line" ~ "Cell line")
summary[is.na(summary$Type), "Type"] <- "Treated"
summary$Period <- case_when(grepl("Pre",summary$Description) | grepl("Day 1", summary$Description) ~ "Early",
                            grepl("Day 28",summary$Description) ~ "Late")
rownames(summary) <- summary$Sample
```

Below we show only the metadata for the 7 patients.

```{r metadata, echo=FALSE}

show <- subset(summary, Type == "Treated") %>%
  select(`BeatAML Patient ID`, Period, Plex, Description) %>%
  dplyr::rename(ID = `BeatAML Patient ID`) %>%
  arrange(ID, Period) %>%
  mutate(Plex = as.character(Plex))

kbl(show) %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)

```

$$\\[0.5in]$$ 
 
Each of the 7 patients has both an early and late period. From these 7 samples, 4 consist 
of only two time points (early point and late point) while the other 3 have multiple late time points. 
We use these 7 patients to run GSEA (on global data) and KSEA (on phospho data) to compare the late 
period to early period for each sample. After collecting these enrichment results, we re-adjust 
the p-values using "BH" (Benjamini Hochberg) correction. We select only the top 50 most enriched
pathways and select those with an adjusted p-value below 0.05. 

In these plots, red indicates increased activity in the late period, while blue shows increased
activity in the early period. Moreover, the asterisk indicates an adjusted p-value below 0.05 for that particular
patient + pathway.

### GSEA heatmaps

We use the net enrichment score for each pathway + patient combination in the heatmap.
