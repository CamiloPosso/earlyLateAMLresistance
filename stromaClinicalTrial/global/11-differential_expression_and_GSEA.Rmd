## Get dataset

We access synapse to load the data in long form. We use data which has been corrected for both
Loading mass effect, as well as plex effect. Below we see a metadata table for this experiment.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
show <- summary %>%
  select(-`BeatAML Patient ID`)
kbl(show) %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)

```

Here we perform 4 comparisons. We compare the healthy group to the treated,
treated & early, and treated & late groups. We also compare the treated & early vs
treated & late groups.

```{r prepare groups, limma, and early vs late gsea, include=FALSE}
##select the samples of interest
healthy <- subset(summary, Type == 'Healthy Donor Stroma')%>%
  select(Sample)%>%
  unique()

treated.late <- subset(summary, Period == "Late")%>%
  select(Sample)%>%
  unique()

treated.early <- subset(summary, Period == "Early")%>%
  select(Sample)%>%
  unique()

treated <- subset(summary, Type == 'Treated')%>%
  select(Sample)%>%
  unique()

##then we spread the proteomics data into a matrix
colnames(prot.dat)[[1]] <- "Gene"
prot.mat <- prot.dat%>%
  select(LogRatio,Sample,Gene)%>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(values_from='LogRatio',names_from='Sample',
                      values_fn=list(LogRatio=mean),values_fill=0.0)%>%
  tibble::column_to_rownames('Gene')

prot.diffex.early.late <- amlresistancenetworks::limmaTwoFactorDEAnalysis(prot.mat,treated.early$Sample,treated.late$Sample) %>%
  rename(value = "logFC") %>%
  mutate(Gene = rownames(.))
gsea_data <- plotOldGSEA(prot.diffex.early.late, "Treated-early-period-vs-Treated-late-period", width = 15, order.by = "p.adjust")

prot.diffex.treated <- amlresistancenetworks::limmaTwoFactorDEAnalysis(prot.mat,healthy$Sample,treated$Sample) %>%
  rename(value = "logFC") %>%
  mutate(Gene = rownames(.))

prot.diffex.treated.late <- amlresistancenetworks::limmaTwoFactorDEAnalysis(prot.mat,healthy$Sample,treated.late$Sample) %>%
  rename(value = "logFC") %>%
  mutate(Gene = rownames(.))

prot.diffex.treated.early <- amlresistancenetworks::limmaTwoFactorDEAnalysis(prot.mat,healthy$Sample,treated.early$Sample) %>%
  rename(value = "logFC") %>%
  mutate(Gene = rownames(.))

```


```{r computing remaining GSEA, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

plotOldGSEA(prot.diffex.treated, "Healthy-vs-Treated", width = 15)


plotOldGSEA(prot.diffex.treated.late, "Healthy-vs-Treated, late-period", width = 15)


plotOldGSEA(prot.diffex.treated.early, "Healthy-vs-Treated, early-period", width = 15)

```

Below we collect the most significant differentially expressed genes using the comparisons stated above, 
as well as a GSEA plot made using a ranking of log-fold changes in gene expression.
With a logarithmic scale we collect the adjusted p-values of each normalized enrichment score. 
Note the GSEA plot shows only the top 20 most enriched gene sets among those 
with an adjusted p-value below 0.05.

## Healthy vs Treated

We compare the healthy donor samples to all treated samples.
Red indicates up regulation in treated samples, while blue shows up-regulation
in healthy samples.

```{r Treated vs Healthy, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 14}
show <- prot.diffex.treated %>%
  select(-featureID, -t, -B) %>% head(.)
kbl(show) %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)

```

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Healthy vs Treated")}
knitr::include_graphics("sig-includedHealthy-vs-Treated-gseaGO-plot.png")
```

## Healthy vs Treated early

Next, we compare healthy samples to early treatment samples, ie,
healthy samples to day 1 and pre-study samples.
Red indicates up regulation in early samples, while blue shows up-regulation
in healthy samples.

```{r Treated early vs Healthy, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 14}
show <- prot.diffex.treated.early %>%
  select(-featureID, -t, -B) %>% head(.)
kbl(show) %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Healthy vs Treated early period")}
knitr::include_graphics("sig-includedHealthy-vs-Treated, early-period-gseaGO-plot.png")
```

## Healthy vs Treated late

Next, we compare healthy samples to late treatment samples, ie,
healthy samples to day 28 samples. Red indicates up-regulation in treated samples,
while blue shows up-regulation in healthy samples.

```{r Treated late vs Healthy, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 14}
show <- prot.diffex.treated.late %>%
  select(-featureID, -t, -B) %>% head(.)
kbl(show) %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Healthy vs Treated late period")}
knitr::include_graphics("sig-includedHealthy-vs-Treated, late-period-gseaGO-plot.png")
```

## Treated early vs treated late

Finally, among the treated samples, we compare the early (day 1 and pre-study) samples
to the late (day 28) samples. Red indicates up regulation in late samples,
while blue shows up-regulation in early samples.

```{r Treated early vs late, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 14}
show <- prot.diffex.early.late %>%
  select(-featureID, -t, -B) %>% head(.)
kbl(show) %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Treated early vs Treated late")}
knitr::include_graphics("sig-includedTreated-early-period-vs-Treated-late-period-gseaGO-plot.png")
```

As there seem to be 5 fairly significant gene sets, we collect below the genes present in these 5
sets. Note that genes appearing near the top indicate a stronger contribution to the enrichment score.
In order to present the genes as a table, we've added NA padding to obtain lists of equal length.

```{r}
gsea_data <- filter(as.data.frame(gsea_data), p.adjust < 0.05)
top_gsea_data <- gsea_data %>% dplyr::rename(pathway = "Description") %>%
    arrange(NES) %>% dplyr::mutate(status = case_when(NES > 0 ~ "Up", NES < 0 ~ "Down"),
                                   status = factor(status, levels = c("Up", "Down"))) %>%
    group_by(status) %>%
    top_n(20, wt = abs(NES)) %>% ungroup()
top_gsea_data <- top_gsea_data[order(top_gsea_data$p.adjust),]

genes <- list()
for (i in 1:5) {
  pathway <- top_gsea_data$pathway[[i]]
  genes[[pathway]] <- strsplit(top_gsea_data$core_enrichment[[i]],"/")[[1]]
  padding <- rep(NA, 90-length(genes[[pathway]]))
  genes[[pathway]] <- c(genes[[pathway]],padding)
}

genes <- data.frame(genes)
colnames(genes) <- sapply(colnames(genes), FUN = function(x) gsub("[.]", " ", x))

kbl(genes) %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = T)

```
